    <h1> The Biosphere and Short Term Carbon Cycle: </h1>

    <h3> 1. What is the biosphere? </h3>
    <ul> 
       <li> The biosphere is crucial for cycling nutrients and carbon throughout the Earth's system </li> 
       <li> The biosphere supports life in the ocean, atmosphere, land, surface, and soil </li>
       <li> The biosphere also plays an important dynamic role in Earth's system </li>
    </ul>

    <h3> 2. What are autotrophs? </h3>
    <ul>
        <li> Autotrophs are primary producers </li>
        <li> Autotrophs are photosynthesizers and there are chemosynthesizers </li>
        <li> Energy needed from life comes from autotrophs </li>
    </ul>

    <h3> 3. Explain Photosynthesis  </h3>
    <ul>
        <li> Autotrophs take in sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water </li>
        <li> They use this to produce oxygen and glucose   </li>
        <li> Energy needed from life comes from autotrophs </li>
    </ul>

    <h3> 4. What is a biogeochemical cycle?  </h3>
    <ul>
        <li> Biogeochemical cycles are tracking a single element throughout the biosphere and other earth system spheres </li>
    </ul>

    <h3> 5. Explain the difference between organic and inorganic carbon  </h3>
    <ul>
        <li> Organic carbon contain c-c and c-h bonds and inorganic carbon does not contain them.  </li>
        <li> Organic carbon can be formed by living organisms while inorganic carbon typically isn't formed by lving organisms  </li>
        <li> Organic carbon examples are sugars and carbs, and inorganic carbon examples are carbonates and carbon dioxide</li>
    </ul>

    <h3> 6. Explain the difference between oxidized and reduced carbon  </h3>
    <ul>
        <li> Oxidized carbon forms with oxygen while reduced carbon forms with C,N,H </li>
        <li> Oxidized carbon is inorganic [c. dioxide and carbonates] are more inert and reduced carbon is organic and reactive </li>
    </ul>

    <h3> 7. What are reservoirs? Which reservoirs have fast fluxes, and which have slow fluxes?  </h3>
    <ul>
        <li> Reservoirs are characterized by the amount of material they are holding at a particular time </li>
        <li> Fast: atmospheric methane, living biomass, atmospheric carbon dioxide, oceanic dissolved carbon dioxide </li>
        <li> Slow: Oceanic bicarbonate ion, organic carbon in sedementary rocks, limestone in sedementary rocks</li>
    </ul>

    <h3> 8. How do reservoirs become inbalanced?  </h3>
    <ul>
        <li> Reservoirs become inbalanced do to perturbations in the system </li>
        <li> This is important to remember for the smaller reservoirs with fast fluxes </li>
    </ul>

    <h3> 9. What is steady state and how is it maitained? </h3>
    <ul>
        <li> Steady state is when the level in the reservoir is constant with time </li>
        <li> For this to be maintained, the inflow/outflow rates must be sensitive to changes in the reservoir size </li>
    </ul>

    <h3> 10. What is residence time? </h3>
    <ul>
        <li> Residence time is the average length of time some substance spends in a given reservoir @ steady state </li>
        <li> Residence_Time = Steady_State_Reservoir.size() / Inflow_Or_OutFlow_Rate </li>
    </ul>

    <h3> 11. How is carbon transferred between the major components of the Earth's system? </h3>
     <ul>
         <li> Biosphere to atm-ocean: respiration/decay </li>
         <li> Biosphere to crust: burial </li>
         <li> Crust to mantle: subduction </li>
         <li> Mantle to crust: sea floor spreading </li>
         <li> Crust to atm-ocean: weathering </li>
         <li> Mantle to atm-ocean: volcanism </li>
    </ul>
