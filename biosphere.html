    <h1> The Biosphere and Short Term Carbon Cycle: </h1>

    <h3> 1. What is the biosphere? </h3>
    <ul> 
       <li> The biosphere is crucial for cycling nutrients and carbon throughout the Earth's system </li> 
       <li> The biosphere supports life in the ocean, atmosphere, land, surface, and soil </li>
       <li> The biosphere also plays an important dynamic role in Earth's system </li>
    </ul>

    <h3> 2. What are autotrophs? </h3>
    <ul>
        <li> Autotrophs are primary producers </li>
        <li> There are photosynthesizers and there are chemosynthesizers </li>
        <li> Energy needed from life comes from autotrophs </li>
    </ul>

    <h3> 3. Explain Photosynthesis  </h3>
    <ul>
        <li> Autotrophs take in sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water </li>
        <li> They use this to produce oxygen and glucose   </li>
        <li> Energy needed from life comes from autotrophs </li>
    </ul>

    <h3> 4. What is a biogeochemical cycle?  </h3>
    <ul>
        <li> Biogeochemical cycles are tracking a single element throughout the biosphere and other earth system spheres </li>
    </ul>

    <h3> 5. Explain the difference between organic and inorganic carbon  </h3>
    <ul>
        <li> Organic carbon contain c-c and c-h bonds and inorganic carbon does not contain them.  </li>
        <li> Organic carbon can be formed by living organisms while inorganic carbon typically isn't formed by lving organisms  </li>
        <li> Organic carbon examples are sugars and carbs, and inorganic carbon examples are carbonates and carbon dioxide</li>
    </ul>

    <h3> 6. Explain the difference between oxidized and reduced carbon  </h3>
    <ul>
        <li> Oxidized carbon forms with oxygen while reduced carbon forms with C,N,H </li>
        <li> Oxidized carbon is inorganic [c. dioxide and carbonates] are more inert and reduced carbon is organic and reactive </li>
    </ul>
